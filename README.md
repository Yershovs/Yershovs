## Hi there 👋

### Math + Code + Applied Mathematics ✨  

📚 Math undergrad @ MSU | Exploring the wildlands where **algorithms** and **abstract algebra** collide.  
💻 Code in: `C++`, `Python`, sometimes `LaTex`.  
🔍 Into: ML, optimization, and formal proofs that end with "QED" or "¯\_(ツ)_/¯".  
☕ Fueled by: Coffee, Latex, and compiler errors.  

*"If it works, it’s probability; if not, it’s statistics."*
